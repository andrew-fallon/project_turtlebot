Our team has decided to create a node which stores the locations and places markers in RViz where the robot has detected an object of interest. The motivation behind this idea is that it will be useful in the final project when we need to explore the map to determine the location of all objects of interest. Once the locations are stored, the robot will be able to return to those locations upon request via user input.
